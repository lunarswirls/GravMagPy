## Installation
GravMagPy can be installed as a Python package called "gravmagpy" for easy access to functions and visualization tools. 
This was done so that one could organize files into separate directories and still be able to reference each file
by defining a path relative to the package root name.

To install as a local branch (highly recommended. NOTE the "-e" flag to install as a local branch! Again, highly 
recommended you do not ignore the "-e" flag!)

```
pip install -e <path/to/your/local/python/package/directory containing setup.py>
```
NOTE: This is not a path to setup.py! This is the path to the root directory containing setup.py!

As an example, if you are user tycho and you want to use your copy of the gravmagpy package that you put in 
`/homes/tycho/code/GravMagPy/gravmagpy`, you would do:
```
pip install -e /homes/tycho/code/GravMagPy/
```
