# Seafloor spreading magnetic test cases

These inputs provide progressively more complex finite-volume magnetic models for an Earth-radius sphere. Run them with `rsphere_km=6371.2`.

## Cases

### `st_paul_reference_body.in`

A single rectangular polygon based on the synthetic validation body in Sichler et al. (2002):

- 4 km across strike
- 10 km along strike
- 1 km thick
- 10 A/m magnetization

The body is centered on the equator and placed from 2.5 to 3.5 km depth.

### `st_paul_symmetric_stripes.in`

A symmetric 16-body block model using the St. Paul Fracture Zone full spreading rate of 31.47 km/Myr and a 0.5 km thick source layer. Each flank therefore grows at 15.735 km/Myr. Stripe boundaries use the following geomagnetic polarity ages:

| boundary | age [Ma] | distance from axis [km] | distance from axis [deg] |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Brunhes base | 0.781 | 12.287 | 0.1104 |
| Jaramillo top | 0.988 | 15.545 | 0.1397 |
| Jaramillo base | 1.072 | 16.867 | 0.1515 |
| Cobb Mountain top | 1.173 | 18.456 | 0.1658 |
| Cobb Mountain base | 1.185 | 18.646 | 0.1675 |
| Olduvai top | 1.778 | 27.977 | 0.2513 |
| Olduvai base | 1.945 | 30.603 | 0.2749 |
| Matuyama/Gauss | 2.595 | 40.831 | 0.3668 |

The unusually narrow Cobb Mountain bodies deliberately test thin-volume handling. Normal and reversed blocks use equal 10 A/m amplitudes with opposite global Cartesian inclinations.

### `st_paul_segmented_transform_alteration.in`

An 18-body stress case combining:

- two 12 km long ridge segments
- a 0.08 degree right step across a transform gap
- symmetric normal and reversed stripes through the Jaramillo interval
- an irregular transferred sliver representing ridge propagation or a ridge jump
- an overlapping 8 A/m opposite-polarity correction body that reduces a local normal stripe from 10 to 2 A/m

The 4 km wide correction is inspired by the reduced-magnetization zone at the TAG hydrothermal field. Its 14-point closed outline contains 13 unique vertices and activates the solver's complex-polygon classification at the default 12-vertex threshold.

The source papers constrain the dimensions and magnetic contrasts, but these files are synthetic solver tests rather than reconstructions of the cited survey grids. Constant depth replaces the bathymetry-following upper surfaces used in the published models.

## Running

From `examples/gravmag_sphere`:

```bash
./gravmag_sphere_bxyz 6371.2 \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/st_paul_reference_body.in \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/output/st_paul_reference_body_xyz.txt 1

./gravmag_sphere_bxyz 6371.2 \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/st_paul_symmetric_stripes.in \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/output/st_paul_symmetric_stripes_xyz.txt 1

./gravmag_sphere_gauss 6371.2 \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/st_paul_segmented_transform_alteration.in \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/output/st_paul_segmented_transform_alteration_xyz.txt
```

The direct solver is the clearest reference for the narrow bodies. The segmented case is intended to exercise collective multi-body accumulation, polygon-edge correction, and automatic hybrid evaluation.

## Plotting

`plot_bxyz.py` reads the source geometry from a `.in` file, sums `Bx`, `By`, and `Bz` over repeated body ids in a direct-solver output, recomputes `Btot` from the summed vector, and overlays the source outlines on four field panels. It also accepts collective spectral output, which already contains one row per observation point.

```bash
/Users/danywaller/code/venvs/gravmagpy/bin/python \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/plot_bxyz.py \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/st_paul_symmetric_stripes.in \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/output/st_paul_symmetric_stripes_xyz.txt \
  seafloor_spreading_cases/figs/st_paul_symmetric_stripes_bxyz.png
```

The image path is optional. When omitted, the script writes `<output_stem>_bxyz.png` in `figs/` beside the source `.in` file's directory. Numeric solver defaults use that same input directory's `output/` folder. Explicit output paths are preserved; see [output path conventions](../../../docs/output_paths.md).
