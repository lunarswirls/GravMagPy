# Input-relative output paths

Numeric products use `output/` and figures use `figs/` under the input file's directory. The location of the launcher and the current working directory do not determine these defaults.

For example:

```text
examples/earth_crust_cases/
  bangui_equivalent_dipoles.in
  output/
    bangui_equivalent_dipoles.txt
  figs/
    bangui_equivalent_dipoles_bxyz.png
```

Directories are created when files are written. A derived input already inside an `output/` or `figs/` tree belongs to that tree's parent case directory: conversion does not create `output/output/`, and plotting a saved equivalent-source CSV uses sibling `figs/` rather than `output/figs/`. For multiple observation CSVs, the first input determines the default case directory; Python observation plots/saves use the first retained input in `source_file` metadata.

Explicit destinations override defaults. Multi-case diagnostic workflows use their configured diagnostic workspace destinations.

The Reiner Gamma case uses `reiner_gamma_test/output/` for tables and caches and singular `reiner_gamma_test/fig/` for its case-specific plots. Other case defaults use `figs/`.

## Fortran executables

| Program | Omitted output argument |
|---|---|
| `gravmag_sphere_bxyz R input.in` | `input-directory/output/input.txt` |
| `gravmag_sphere_gauss R input.in` | `input-directory/output/input_gauss.txt` |
| `gravmag_xyz_to_brtp input_xyz.txt` | `case-directory/output/input_brtp.txt` |
| `gravmag_sphere_dipole_grid_fit R observations.csv` | `input-directory/output/observations_dipole_fit_predictions.csv` and `observations_dipole_fit_dipoles.csv` |

Pass an empty string (`""`) in an output argument's positional slot to request its default while supplying later solver options. Output paths are command-line arguments, not input-card fields. Shell wrappers use `_xyz`, `_gauss`, and `_brtp` filename suffixes according to the selected workflow.

`fortran/gravmag_paths.f90` handles defaults and directory creation for the four executables. The Python build utility, shell builder, and diagnostic compiler driver include it automatically. Custom compile commands must compile it before the program using it, with the same module include/output directory. Directory creation uses POSIX `mkdir`, with paths shell-quoted to preserve spaces and special characters. The orbital shared-library kernel returns arrays and does not create output directories.

## Python

```python
from gravmagpy import run_grid_model
from gravmagpy.plotting import plot_fields
from gravmagpy.utils import artifact_path

input_path = "examples/earth_crust_cases/bangui_equivalent_dipoles.in"
run = run_grid_model(input_path, radius_km=6371.2)
figure = plot_fields(input_path, run["output_path"])
chosen_figure = artifact_path(input_path, kind="figs", suffix="_comparison.png")
```

`run_grid_model` accepts an omitted output path. `plot_fields`, `plot_fit`, and `plot_equivalent_maps` accept an omitted image path. `save_fit` accepts an omitted directory when observation `source_file` metadata are available. In-memory observations/solutions without file provenance require an explicit save or figure destination. `run_sphere_model` and `fit_equivalent_sources` return arrays without automatically persisting files; supply `output_dir` to save their products.

The batch Python and Bash runners default to `<examples-dir>/output` and, for the Python plotting runner, `<examples-dir>/figs`. Explicit batch directory overrides are launcher-relative when supplied as relative paths; absolute paths are used as supplied. Single-case file arguments are relative to the caller's working directory.

Each single-case Bash launcher resolves its input-relative paths directly, accounting for `output/` and `figs/` ancestors to avoid nested output directories.

LPMAG wake examples save under the configured `wake_dir/output/<workflow>` and `wake_dir/figs/<workflow>`. `plot_equivalent_geotiffs.py` reads `wake_dir/output/equivalent_wake/dipoles.csv` and writes into `wake_dir/figs/equivalent_geotiffs`; set `source_path` to select a different saved solution. Synthetic and dictionary-generated examples have no external input file and use local `output/` and `figs/` directories. See the architecture's [LPMAG reference workflow](architecture.md#lpmag-reference-workflow) for input conventions.
